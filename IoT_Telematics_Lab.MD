# Week 8 Telematics Lab - IoT, InsureTech, ML/AI

We have included a dataset provided by an insurance group. They have taken real data and used a few advanced methods to reproduce it's statistical features
while protecting their customers privacy.

Consider using it as either for either a Regression project to estimate Claim Sizes, or a Classification challenge to predict which drivers are most likely
to have an accident resulting in a claim. 

The data can be found in the file:
telematics_lab.csv

Happy modeling!
