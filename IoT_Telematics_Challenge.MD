# Exploring Raw Telematics Data

Up for a tough challenge?

The following dataset comprises Raw Telematics Data From a car insurance group.

The data is anonymized, so we do not know much about each driver.

Each folder contains one drivers recorded trips, with their X and Y location encoded from start to finish of their trip in meters.

We do not know the time interval. 

Mixed in is a series of fake trips and trips from other drivers. 

Can you build a model to detect them?

This is a very hard problem. 

See the folder TripData in this repository.
