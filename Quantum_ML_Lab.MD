# Want to try out Quantum Machine Learning?

### Extend your Week 7 Project and learn PyTorch at the same time! 

Consider following the guide here to add a PyTorch FeedForward ML model with a hybrid Quantum Layer to your week 7 project.

Please send me a message on Discord if you succeed or would like to share your work with the class :)

#### Step One:
Read the following material that was shared on Learn from Day 1 this week.

https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-machine-learning/machine-learning-qiskit-pytorch.html

This example makes use of a simple Computer Vision task.
We need to modify the example code slightly to get it to work for our problems.

Remove the Conv2D layers.

#### Step Two:

Get a simple PyTorch Fully Connected model to work for your Week 7 Data Science Project.

#### Step Three:

Add a Hybrid Quantum Layer.

#### Step Four:

Compare your original project results to Step Two and Step Three.

Which one worked best?
